The model now correctly captures individual player tendencies:

1. WHO ends possessions: Weighted by each player's usage rate
   - High usage players (stars) get more possessions
   - Role players get fewer possessions

2. WHAT they do: Based on their shot distribution
   - 3PT shooters take more 3s
   - Post players take more 2s
   
3. SUCCESS RATE: Based on their actual shooting %
   - Good shooters make more shots
   - Poor shooters make fewer shots

Example: Steph Curry vs Jonathan Kuminga
- Curry: Higher usage (more possessions)
- Curry: Higher 3PT rate (more 3s when he shoots)
- Curry: Higher 3PT% (makes more when he takes 3s)
