# Energy Pool System Implementation (Option C)

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've integrated the **Energy Pool System (Option C)** into both `main.py` and `player_aware_predictor.py`. This is a game-like fatigue system where each player has an energy pool that depletes with activity.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Energy Tracking

Each player starts with **100 energy**:
- **100-80 energy**: Fresh (100% performance)
- **80-50 energy**: Getting tired (85-100% performance)
- **50-20 energy**: Tired (70-85% performance)
- **20-0 energy**: Exhausted (50-70% performance)

### 2. Energy Depletion

Energy depletes based on activity:
- **Base cost**: 1.0 energy per possession (just being on court)
- **Intensity bonus**: Extra cost for high-effort plays
  - Player who ends possession: +0.5 energy cost
  - 2PT attempts (driving): +0.3 energy cost
  - Turnovers (scrambling): +0.2 energy cost

**Example:**
```
Curry takes a 3-pointer (makes it):
- Base cost: 1.0 (on court)
- Intensity: 0.5 (he took the shot)
- Total: 1.5 energy depleted

Draymond just plays defense:
- Base cost: 1.0 (on court)
- Intensity: 0.0 (didn't touch ball)
- Total: 1.0 energy depleted
```

### 3. Energy Recovery

Bench players recover **2.0 energy per possession**:
- After ~50 possessions rest: fully recovered
- Realistic for NBA rotation patterns

### 4. Fatigue Effects on Performance

Fatigue affects THREE things:

#### A. Usage Rate (Who Gets the Ball)
```python
# Fresh Curry (energy=100, fatigue_mult=1.0):
usage = 0.30 * 1.0 = 0.30 (30% of possessions)

# Tired Curry (energy=40, fatigue_mult=0.70):
usage = 0.30 * 0.70 = 0.21 (21% of possessions)

# → Tired players get ball less, coach spreads usage
```

#### B. Shooting Percentage
```python
# Fresh Curry shooting 3PT (fatigue_mult=1.0):
3PT% = 43% * 1.0 = 43% make rate

# Tired Curry (fatigue_mult=0.70):
3PT% = 43% * 0.70 = 30% make rate

# → Tired players miss more shots
```

#### C. Turnover Rate
```python
# Tired players have extra turnover chance:
turnover_chance = (1.0 - fatigue_mult) * 0.05

# Fresh (fatigue_mult=1.0): 0% extra TOs
# Tired (fatigue_mult=0.70): 1.5% extra TOs  
# Exhausted (fatigue_mult=0.50): 2.5% extra TOs

# → Tired players lose ball more
```

---

## Code Changes

### In `main.py` - GameEngine Class

#### 1. Added to `__init__`:
```python
# Energy Pool System (Option C)
self.player_energy = {pid: 100.0 for pid in all_players}
self.player_minutes = {pid: 0.0 for pid in all_players}
```

#### 2. New Methods:
```python
get_fatigue_multiplier(player_id) → float
    # Converts energy (0-100) to performance multiplier (0.5-1.0)

deplete_energy(player_id, base_cost, intensity_bonus)
    # Reduces player's energy based on activity

rest_player(player_id)
    # Regenerates energy for bench players (+2.0 per possession)

substitute_player(team, position, new_player_id)
    # Swaps a player in the lineup
```

#### 3. Updated `step()`:
```python
# Before prediction - calculate fatigue
fatigue_multipliers = {
    pid: self.get_fatigue_multiplier(pid)
    for pid in offensive_lineup + defensive_lineup
}

# Pass fatigue to predictor
result = self.predictor.sample_possession_detailed(
    ...,
    fatigue_multipliers=fatigue_multipliers
)

# After prediction - deplete energy for players on court
for player_id in offensive_lineup + defensive_lineup:
    base_cost = 1.0
    intensity_bonus = 0.5 if player_id == result['player_id'] else 0.0
    # ... add bonuses for drive, turnover, etc.
    self.deplete_energy(player_id, base_cost, intensity_bonus)

# Rest bench players
for player_id in bench_players:
    self.rest_player(player_id)
```

### In `player_aware_predictor.py`

#### 1. New Methods:
```python
select_player_with_fatigue(offensive_lineup, season, fatigue_multipliers)
    # Selects player weighted by: usage_rate * fatigue_multiplier
    # Tired players less likely to get ball

predict_outcome_with_fatigue(player_id, action, season, fatigue_multiplier)
    # Reduces shooting % by fatigue
    # Adds extra turnover chance
```

#### 2. Updated `sample_possession_detailed()`:
```python
# Now accepts fatigue_multipliers parameter
def sample_possession_detailed(
    self,
    offensive_lineup,
    defensive_lineup,
    season,
    score_margin=0,
    period=1,
    fatigue_multipliers=None  # ← New parameter
):
    # Uses fatigue-aware player selection
    player_id = self.select_player_with_fatigue(...)
    
    # Uses fatigue-adjusted shooting
    outcome = self.predict_outcome_with_fatigue(...)
```

## How Fatigue Affects Games

### Example Scenario: Warriors vs Lakers

**Start of Game (Q1):**
```
Curry: Energy=100, Fatigue=1.0
- Usage: 30% of possessions
- 3PT%: 43%
- Gets ball a lot, shoots well
```

**Mid-Q2 (after 6 game minutes):**
```
Curry: Energy=75, Fatigue=0.975
- Usage: 29.3% of possessions (slightly less)
- 3PT%: 41.9% (slightly worse)
- Still playing well
```

**End of Q3 (after 12 game minutes without rest):**
```
Curry: Energy=25, Fatigue=0.625
- Usage: 18.8% of possessions (much less)
- 3PT%: 26.9% (significantly worse)
- Needs substitution!
```

**After 5 minutes rest (50 possessions on bench):**
```
Curry: Energy=100, Fatigue=1.0
- Back to full strength
```

## Using the System

### Check Player Energy

```python
game = GameEngine(...)

# Check a player's current state
curry_id = 201939
energy = game.player_energy[curry_id]
fatigue = game.get_fatigue_multiplier(curry_id)
minutes = game.player_minutes[curry_id]

print(f"Curry: {energy:.0f} energy, {fatigue:.1%} performance, {minutes:.1f} min")
# Output: "Curry: 65 energy, 80.0% performance, 8.3 min"
```

### Make Substitutions

```python
# Check who needs rest
for i, player_id in enumerate(game.home_lineup):
    if game.get_fatigue_multiplier(player_id) < 0.75:
        # Player is tired (< 75% performance)
        # Find a rested bench player
        bench = [pid for pid in game.player_energy.keys() 
                if pid not in game.home_lineup and game.player_energy[pid] > 80]
        
        if bench:
            fresh_player = max(bench, key=lambda p: game.player_energy[p])
            game.substitute_player('home', i, fresh_player)
            print(f"SUB: OUT {player_id} (tired), IN {fresh_player} (fresh)")
```

### Monitor Team Energy

```python
# Check average team fatigue
home_fatigue = np.mean([
    game.get_fatigue_multiplier(pid) 
    for pid in game.home_lineup
])

print(f"Home team average: {home_fatigue:.1%} performance")

if home_fatigue < 0.70:
    print("Team is exhausted! Need substitutions!")
```

## Energy Cost Examples

### Low Intensity Play (Spot-up 3PT)
```
Player shoots catch-and-shoot 3:
- Base: 1.0
- Shooter: 0.5
- Shot type: 0.0 (3PT is not tiring)
Total: 1.5 energy

Teammates:
- Base: 1.0
Total: 1.0 energy each
```

### High Intensity Play (Drive to Basket)
```
Player drives for layup:
- Base: 1.0
- Shooter: 0.5
- Drive: 0.3 (driving is tiring)
Total: 1.8 energy

Teammates:
- Base: 1.0
Total: 1.0 energy each
```

### Turnover (Scramble)
```
Player loses ball:
- Base: 1.0
- Ball handler: 0.5
- Turnover: 0.2 (scrambling for ball)
Total: 1.7 energy

Teammates:
- Base: 1.0
Total: 1.0 energy each
```

---

## Realistic Game Timeline

### Quarter 1 (12 minutes, ~24 possessions)
```
Start: All starters at 100 energy
After 6 min: Starters at 75-85 energy
End Q1: Starters at 60-75 energy

→ Sub at 6-minute mark typical
```

### Quarter 2 (Bench players)
```
Starters rest: 75 energy → 100 energy (full recovery)
Bench plays: 100 energy → 70-80 energy
```

### Quarter 3 (Starters return)
```
Starters fresh again at 100 energy
Can play heavy minutes
```

### Quarter 4 (Crunch time)
```
Starters: 65-80 energy (getting tired)
Need to manage energy carefully
Close games: play through fatigue
Blowouts: rest starters
```

## Substitution Integration

The energy system naturally drives substitutions:

```python
def check_substitutions(self):
    """Check if players need rest based on energy"""
    for team in ['home', 'away']:
        lineup = self.home_lineup if team == 'home' else self.away_lineup
        
        for i, player_id in enumerate(lineup):
            energy = self.player_energy[player_id]
            
            # Sub out if energy below 40 (getting exhausted)
            if energy < 40:
                # Find bench player with high energy
                roster = self.hometeam.roster_df if team == 'home' else self.awayteam.roster_df
                bench = [pid for pid in roster['PLAYER_ID'].tolist() 
                        if pid not in lineup and self.player_energy[pid] > 70]
                
                if bench:
                    # Sub in the freshest bench player
                    sub_in = max(bench, key=lambda p: self.player_energy[p])
                    self.substitute_player(team, i, sub_in)
```

---

## Timeout Integration

Timeouts force deadballs for substitutions:

```python
def should_call_timeout(self, team):
    """
    Call timeout if team is exhausted but no natural deadball
    """
    lineup = self.home_lineup if team == 'home' else self.away_lineup
    
    # Calculate average team energy
    avg_energy = np.mean([self.player_energy[pid] for pid in lineup])
    
    # Team exhausted and no deadball?
    if avg_energy < 50 and not self.deadball:
        timeouts = self.home_timeouts if team == 'home' else self.away_timeouts
        if timeouts > 0:
            return True  # Call timeout to sub!
    
    return False

def call_timeout(self, team):
    """
    Call timeout - forces deadball and allows substitutions
    """
    if team == 'home':
        self.home_timeouts -= 1
    else:
        self.away_timeouts -= 1
    
    self.deadball = True
    
    # Make substitutions for tired players
    self.check_substitutions()
```

---

## Testing the System

### Test 1: Verify Energy Depletion

```python
game = GameEngine(hometeam_id=1610612744, awayteam_id=1610612747, season='2023-24')

curry_id = game.home_lineup[0]
print(f"Start: {game.player_energy[curry_id]} energy")

# Simulate 20 possessions
for _ in range(20):
    game.step()

print(f"After 20 possessions: {game.player_energy[curry_id]} energy")
print(f"Minutes played: {game.player_minutes[curry_id]:.1f}")
print(f"Performance: {game.get_fatigue_multiplier(curry_id):.1%}")

# Expected: ~80 energy, 0.5-1 minute, ~95-100% performance
```

### Test 2: Verify Fatigue Effects

```python
from player_aware_predictor import PlayerAwarePredictor

predictor = PlayerAwarePredictor()

lineup = [201939, 201142, 203507, 203999, 2544]  # All-stars
defense = [1628983, 203076, 203114, 203954, 201935]

# Fresh team
fresh_results = []
for _ in range(100):
    result = predictor.sample_possession_detailed(
        offensive_lineup=lineup,
        defensive_lineup=defense,
        season='2023-24',
        fatigue_multipliers={pid: 1.0 for pid in lineup + defense}  # All fresh
    )
    fresh_results.append(result)

# Tired team
tired_results = []
for _ in range(100):
    result = predictor.sample_possession_detailed(
        offensive_lineup=lineup,
        defensive_lineup=defense,
        season='2023-24',
        fatigue_multipliers={pid: 0.65 for pid in lineup + defense}  # All tired
    )
    tired_results.append(result)

# Compare
fresh_points = sum(r['points'] for r in fresh_results)
tired_points = sum(r['points'] for r in tired_results)

print(f"Fresh team: {fresh_points} points in 100 possessions")
print(f"Tired team: {tired_points} points in 100 possessions")
print(f"Performance drop: {(1 - tired_points/fresh_points)*100:.1f}%")

# Expected: Tired team scores 20-35% fewer points
```

### Test 3: Verify Bench Recovery

```python
game = GameEngine(...)

# Get a bench player ID
bench_player = [pid for pid in game.player_energy.keys() 
                if pid not in game.home_lineup][0]

# Deplete their energy
game.player_energy[bench_player] = 50.0

print(f"Bench player start: {game.player_energy[bench_player]} energy")

# Simulate 10 possessions (they rest)
for _ in range(10):
    game.step()

print(f"After 10 possessions rest: {game.player_energy[bench_player]} energy")

# Expected: 50 + (10 * 2.0) = 70 energy
```

---

## Configuration Tuning

You can adjust these values in the code:

### Energy Depletion Rates
```python
# In GameEngine.step():
base_cost = 1.0        # Base cost per possession
intensity_bonus = 0.5  # Extra for player who acted
drive_bonus = 0.3      # Extra for driving
turnover_bonus = 0.2   # Extra for turnovers

# Tune these to make players tire faster/slower
```

### Recovery Rates
```python
# In GameEngine.rest_player():
recovery_rate = 2.0  # Energy per possession of rest

# Higher = faster recovery
# Lower = need longer bench time
```

### Performance Curves
```python
# In GameEngine.get_fatigue_multiplier():
if energy > 80:
    return 1.0         # Fresh threshold
elif energy > 50:
    return 0.85 + ...  # Gradual decline
elif energy > 20:
    return 0.70 + ...  # Rapid decline
else:
    return 0.50 + ...  # Floor (min 50% performance)

# Adjust thresholds to make fatigue kick in earlier/later
```

## Visual Example: Curry's Game

```
Quarter 1:
Poss 1-12:  Energy 100→82  [████████▓▓]  Fresh
Poss 13-24: Energy 82→65   [██████▓▓░░]  Starting to tire
** SUB OUT ** Rest on bench

Quarter 2:
Bench:      Energy 65→100  [██████████]  Recovering

Quarter 3:
Poss 1-12:  Energy 100→82  [████████▓▓]  Fresh again
Poss 13-24: Energy 82→65   [██████▓▓░░]  Tired
** SUB OUT **

Quarter 4 (Close game - plays through fatigue):
Poss 1-24:  Energy 100→45  [████▓░░░░░]  Exhausted
Performance: 75% → shots harder, more TOs
```

## Benefits of Option C

### ✅ Intuitive
- Easy to understand (like video game health bar)
- Clear thresholds (80=fresh, 50=tired, 20=exhausted)
- Visual representation possible

### ✅ Realistic
- Stars play ~32-36 minutes (need to rest)
- Bench players important (starters need rest)
- Fourth quarter fatigue in close games

### ✅ Strategic
- Forces coach decisions (when to sub?)
- Timeouts become important (force subs)
- Depth matters (bench quality affects team)

### ✅ Integrated
- Works seamlessly with ML model
- Affects player selection, shooting, turnovers
- No changes to training data needed

---

## Next Steps: Implementing Substitutions

With energy system in place, add substitution logic:

### Option 1: Automatic Subs
```python
# In GameEngine.step() after energy depletion:
if self.deadball:
    self.check_substitutions()

def check_substitutions(self):
    # Sub out exhausted players (energy < 40)
    # Sub in fresh bench players (energy > 80)
```

### Option 2: Manual Subs (User Control)
```python
# Allow user to make substitution decisions
game.substitute_player('home', position=0, new_player_id=bench_player_id)
```

### Option 3: Strategic AI Subs
```python
# AI coach makes smart decisions
# - Regular rotations (6-minute mark)
# - Fatigue-based (when tired)
# - Situation-based (close game vs blowout)
```
